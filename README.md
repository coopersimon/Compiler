Compiler:

Arithmetic done. (mostly tested)
Function calls done. (mostly tested)
If/else done. (mostly tested)
While, do/while and for done. (For has not been fully tested!)
All arithmetic, bitwise and logical operators done (not fully tested)
Increment and decrement working. (mostly tested)
Scoping/shadowing working (not fully tested)
Arguments(parameters) working (mostly tested)

TODO:
Stress-test the above.

More assignment operators.
Implementation of global variables.
General optimisation:
	Better use of registers (i.e. stop loading from v0 to t0, back into v0)
	Use of registers for STORING variables (s0-s7) : could be very complex
	AST level optimisation
	More intelligent use of the stack?

... and probably more
